        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I was born in Bellevue, Washington at Overlake Hospital on August 23, 1998. I'm an only child and I am really close to my mom and my grandparents. I see my extended family all the time which is really nice because I feel like I know them very well. I have one dog named Buddy because my favorite movie is ELF. I think I've watched that movie so many times it's actually a little concerning consdering the fact that I could recite the movie but at the same time kinda cool. I love rewatching movies even though I know that some people hate doing that but when I watch a movie that I like, I can watch it again and again.</p>

        <h2> My Dog</h2>
        <strong><small><font size="2" color="blue">I've always really loved dogs growing up. My mom would not let me get one forever but now I cant imagine my life without one. When I get older and have a place of my own, I really want a lab or a golden. I think dogs makes life more enjoyable.</strong></font>
